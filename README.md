Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
========================================

Here's how this directory will operate
* Unzip the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
* Make sure the resulting folder "UCI HAR Dataset" and run_analysis.R script are both in the wd.
* run source("run_analysis.R") 
* Two output files are generated in the wd:
  - merge.txt: data frame called cleanedData
  - w_means.txt: data frame called result
* Read the w_means.txt in RStudio
